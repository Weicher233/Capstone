# Capstone
The aim of this study is to construct a set of data-driven transport stop optimisation models to enhance the efficiency of public transport operations and improve the travel convenience of the accessible population. To this end, we synthesise key literature results on bus stop optimisation and accessible travel. Based on the incorporation of previous research, we combine techniques such as GIS spatial analysis, data mining and multi-criteria decision-making techniques to optimise the spatial layout of bus stops, thereby providing decision support for public transport planning in London and promoting the sustainable development of bus stops.
