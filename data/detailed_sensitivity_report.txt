Detailed P-median Sensitivity Analysis Report
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------
This comprehensive sensitivity analysis evaluates the robustness of
P-median facility location recommendations across different parameter settings.
Analysis uses greedy optimization due to solver compatibility issues.

4        73.59        41.34        Seven Sisters, King's Cross St. Pancras Underground Station, Clapton Rail Station, Custom House
5        42.36        31.23        Seven Sisters, King's Cross St. Pancras Underground Station, Clapton Rail Station, Custom House, Woodford Station

4. FACILITY STABILITY ANALYSIS
-----------------------------------
Seven Sisters: 7/7 scenarios (100.0%) - High
King's Cross St. Pancras Underground Station: 7/7 scenarios (100.0%) - High
Clapton Rail Station: 4/7 scenarios (57.1%) - Medium
Stratford: 2/7 scenarios (28.6%) - Low
Custom House: 1/7 scenarios (14.3%) - Low

5. KEY FINDINGS
---------------
Current threshold (η = 4.25) findings:
  - Represents 93.7th percentile cutoff
  - Captures 4 critical OD pairs
  - Involves 7 demand stations
  - Total demand: 21.78

Threshold sensitivity insights:
  - Lower thresholds (2.5-3.0) capture too many marginal cases
  - Higher thresholds (4.5-5.0) may miss important accessibility gaps
  - Current threshold strikes optimal balance

6. RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------
Based on sensitivity analysis:
  1. Current threshold (η = 4.25) is statistically justified
  2. Represents approximately 90th percentile of accessibility performance
  3. Balances capturing critical needs vs. practical implementation
  4. Facility count of p=3 appears optimal for current demand pattern
